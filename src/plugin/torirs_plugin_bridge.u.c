 * these functions and a void* App, which is what keeps the host compilable and
 * testable without the client.
 *
 * Two conversions happen at this boundary and nowhere else:
 *
 *   - Tiles become ABSOLUTE (scene tile + world base tile). A scene rebuild
 *     renumbers every scene-local tile, so a plugin that stored one would find
 *     it pointing somewhere else after a walk across a map square edge.
 *   - Fine positions stay SCENE-RELATIVE, because their only use is being
 *     handed back to app_world_project, which expects exactly that.
