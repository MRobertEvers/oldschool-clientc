-- quest-driver / world: naming a world target.
-- Owner: verbs-pointer (docs/ARCHITECT.md), built on verbs-ui's pool readers.
--
-- A target is always a server content symbol, never an id and never a name a
-- lane happens to spell.  npc.by_symbol matches npc_id OR base_npc_id so a
-- multiNpc wrapper resolves to the shell a test named, and loc_near below
-- matches a multiLoc in both directions -- see pointer.lua's MULTILOC SWAP.
--
-- api_drive is core.lua's chunk-scope upvalue (QD.core_bind) -- see
-- state.lua's banner: there is no `api` global in this chunk, only
-- `api_drive`.
--
-- api_drive.locs/objs/player_tile are verbs-ui's raw primitives
-- (src/plugin/torirs_plugin_drive_ui.c, DriveUi_Locs/Objs/PlayerTile); this
-- file only composes them with a content-symbol lookup. `locs`/`objs` return
-- `result, rows` where `rows` is a 1-indexed array of tables mirroring
-- struct DriveLocRow/DriveObjRow's fields, EXCEPT that the two coordinates
-- are spelled `x`/`z` on the Lua side (loc_id/obj_id, x, z, level,
-- element_id, plus loc's resolved_loc_id and obj's count):
-- lua_drive_locs/lua_drive_objs rename
-- tile_x/tile_z on the way out, and reading the C spelling here filled
-- this verb's own tile_x/tile_z with nil for the life of the file --
-- nothing noticed until pointer.lua's _target_tile needed those two
-- numbers to frame a camera on the loc. `player_tile`
-- returns TWO values, `result, tile` where `tile` is already a table
-- `{x, z, level}` (lua_drive_player_tile, torirs_plugin_drive_ui.c:754-777)
-- -- the four-value `result, x, z, level` this banner originally assumed was
-- wrong (QD-05): world.tile()/world.level() below were destructuring the
-- table itself into `x` and leaving `z`/`level` nil.

-- THE MULTILOC SWAP, on the read verb.  Same three rules as
-- QD.player._live_loc_id (pointer.lua's banner has the measurement, and why a
-- loc target carries the PLACED id rather than the symbol's): exact, then a
-- placement whose live multiloc child IS this symbol, then a placement that
-- is one of this symbol's own slots.  The row handed back is a click target
-- -- player.click_loc reads `tile_x`/`element_id` off it -- so it has to name
-- the id the pool stores, and `match` says which rule found it.
--
-- The rule is resolved over the WHOLE pool and the row is then found inside
-- `radius`: which COPY of a loc is nearest is a different question from which
-- ID the family resolved to, and answering them together would make one
-- symbol resolve differently at radius 5 than at radius 50.
