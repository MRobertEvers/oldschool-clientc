# Looking at the plugins

The port gate answers *did anything move*. It compares component boxes, roles
and owned controls, and it is good at that. It cannot answer *does it look
right*, and for about half the ported plugins nobody had asked, because their
page, tooltip, label or beam is never on screen in a gate lane:

- the loot tracker's page and the XP tracker's page — no lane opens the rail
- the client settings page — same
- item stats' tooltip — no lane hovers anything
- ground items' labels — the fixture's drops are on a different plane from the
  player, so the caption hook never fires
- loot beam's beams — the fixture floor is empty
- the entity highlighter's outlines — the fixture tags nothing

The first time anyone looked, the loot tracker's page turned out to have been
drawing an EMPTY well. Both the overview line and the words "No loot to
display." were in the pre-port source and neither reached the screen. Every
unit test passed, the gate passed on seven lanes, and the page was blank. That
is the whole argument for this directory.

## Use

```
zsh tools/porcelain_gate/shots/shot.sh <name> <cs2|cs1> [ENV=value ...]
```

It writes `<name>.png` beside the script and the run under `runs/<name>/`.
Point it at a different tree with `TORIRS_SHOT_WORKTREE` and a different binary
with `TORIRS_SHOT_BIN`, which is how you take the BEFORE shot: build the commit
the port branched from and capture the same state.

Openers worth knowing, all of them drives the client already had:

| want | env |
|---|---|
| a plugin's page or settings | `TORIRS_SIM_PLUGIN_PANEL=600,<plugin>,<page\|settings>` |
| a plugin config value | `TORIRS_SIM_PLUGIN_CONFIG='60,<plugin>,<key>,<value>'` |
| the pointer somewhere | `TORIRS_SIM_HOVER=x,y` |
| a click | `TORIRS_SIM_CLICK_AT=x,y,<tick>` |
| a key held | `TORIRS_SIM_KEYHOLD=<code>` |
| a server command | `TORIRS_SIM_CMD='<tick>,<command>'` |

## The rule that matters

A screenshot on its own proves nothing: you have to know what it looked like
before. Take the BEFORE shot from the commit the port branched from, with the
same drive, and compare them. Three of the four pages first captured this way
were identical before and after, which is what a faithful port looks like. The
fourth was the bug.
