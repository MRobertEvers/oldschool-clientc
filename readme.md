“When we’re rendering our 3D scene, historically we have sorted all of our world entities (such as players, walls, particle effects etc) into view depth order. We then render them in this order, from furthest away to closest, giving the view you would expect, where nearer things appear over far things. Whilst this has the advantage of being quite fast, it’s also somewhat inflexible, and leads to various graphical glitches that you’re probably familiar with if you play in the ‘Safe mode’ or ‘Software’ graphics modes, whereby things appear to draw on top of - or through - each other when they shouldn’t (player capes are an excellent example of this). With this update, we’ve moved to using an industry-standard technique called ‘Z-buffering’, which allows us to be a lot more flexible with our 3D rendering in the future. As an example, it allows us to have player kit or animations which extend outside of the square on which your character is standing. It also allows for more complex models and a number of other improvements which we’ve been wanting to do for a while.”

The 'method' he is talking about is called Painter's algorithm...it is not the fastest way as far as I see it.
The reason?:
Your drawing more than you need to, and most of it won't be seen by the user (to solve this you would apply culling)
```

### Rendering Notes

Talking about z-buffering.

They assign a "render order" (aka Priority).

### Rendering Notes - Decompiled Painters Algorithm

The decompiled renderer uses the "painters algorithm", and 12 layers.

Higher layers always appear on top of lower layers.

1. Sort model faces by depth. Note: The "depth" of a face is calculated as the average "z". (z0 + z1 + z2) / 3.
2. Partition the sorted faces into their respective layers. Since we are partitioning a sorted array, the resulting arrays are also sorted by layer.
3. For each layer, Render each face back to front

### Rendering Notes - Z Buffering with layers

I found that you can also render with z-buffering instead of sorting by depth.

1. Partition models in layer order.
2. For each layer, reset the z-buffer
3. then render each face.
