WHAT `helper_coverage` AND THE GATE STILL MISS (sampler sonnet-b31).

(a) and (b) were fixed in seam26 (`helper_coverage_credits_by_mention`); the rule is now section 7's
"How a guide step is DRIVEN".

(a) FIXED: a line that names a step's target no longer drives it by mention alone -- The Feud's
`talkToAVillager`/`talkToAVillagerToSpawnMayor` now grade UNMATCHED, because the only villager
presses are `pickpocketVillager1` (op3 Pickpocket, and `pickpocketVillager`'s own row).

(b) FIXED: a custom step class's sub-steps are graded -- Recruitment Drive's
`MissCheeversStep.getPanelSteps()` gather chain is fourteen steps of its own, and a port that hands
the items over in dialogue grades them UNMATCHED.

(c) EVERY PASS ROW NEEDS A DETAIL, and since seam27 `gate.py` fails one without:
`t.check(name, r, d)` over a verb whose detail is nil (`t.await`'s `ok`, `t.ui.await_open`) writes
an empty one, and a sampler sends the quest back for it (The Feud rows `carpet-landed`, `safe-open`)
-- pass your own string naming what landed and where.

(d) The gate's `pre_login` fingerprint can match a real in-game frame (Recruitment Drive's Spishyus
bridge room at the default camera pose); camera yaw decides it and the pose persists across rows
until reset, so turn or reset the camera before that room's shots instead of re-running.

## Sample sonnet-b32 (2026-09-28)

*Origin: section 8 ("Gaps reported by authors").*

SAMPLE sonnet-b32 (2026-09-28).

(a) FIXED (seam27): `t.npc.await_dead_engaged` re-casts under auto-retaliate and eats through
`opts.eat` (section 3) -- no inline cast+eat loop.

(b) SETUP ARMOUR: `rune_platebody` is Dragon Slayer-gated to wear; set up armour this account can
wear.

Other sampler findings live beside the rule they changed: trap 4 (sonnet-b33, repeated pages), trap
12 (sonnet-b27, sonnet-b13), trap 17 (sonnet-b29), trap 21 (sonnet-b12, sonnet-b17), trap 32
(sonnet-b27, sonnet-b28) and the `coordz` side-test gap (sonnet-b16). `INDEX.md` lists them all.
