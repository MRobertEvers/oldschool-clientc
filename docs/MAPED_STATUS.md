# ToriRSEd status (branch v3-maped, after phase 4)

The design is `docs/MAPED_DESIGN.html`; the per-phase ownership brief is
`docs/MAPED_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. This page says what is built against each
design section, what is not, every open issue the four phases left (with the
file and line to start from), and how to run the editor. Read it first when
picking the editor up again.

Commits: phase 0 `86bc224de` (design + brief), 0b `f2998b6af` (picker and New
square in the brief), 1 `a0eeeb676`, 2 `ffdc6be36`, 3 `aa8798eae`, 4 (this
commit; its hash is in the phase-4 integrator's report).

## How to run it

All commands from the repository root. `OSRS-Content` is the content tree the
editor edits; in this worktree it is a symlink into the owner's checkout and is
read only by rule, so editing sessions that SAVE need a writable tree (a real
checkout, or the mirror `src/maped/test/live_e2e/mirror.py` makes).

**Native, one window, embedded editor server** (the default):

    make -C src
    src/torirs --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini

The manifest's `[editor:boot] server=embed` runs ToriRSMapEd inside the
process over `content_dir`. The panel set (menu bar, tool rail, terrain,
palettes, square picker, New, locs, spawns, inspector, catalog, console,
builders, interface and CS2 tools, Live) is in the same window; the View menu
opens the hidden ones.

**Native, against the daemon** (several windows on one tree):

    make -C src torirsmaped torirsmapedctl
    src/build_opt/torirsmaped 43610 --content-dir OSRS-Content/osrs-content --repo-root . \
        [--view-binary src/torirs --view-manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini] \
        [--live-dir <dir>]

then boot the client with `server=tcp` in `[editor:boot]` (host/port default
localhost:43610). `torirsmapedctl` drives the same daemon headless: `status`,
`squares`, `open`, `doc`, `new`, `select`, `undo`/`redo`, `save`, and since
phase 4 `text-replace`, `tile-height`, `live-attach`, `live-detach`,
`live-cheat`, `build packs|client`, `run`.

**Viewer window** (a second camera on the same session):

    src/torirs --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini --editor-view \
        --maped tcp://127.0.0.1:43610 --maped-group <client id> --camera x,z,level,yaw,pitch,zoom

or "Open in new view" in the picker (the daemon spawns it when started with
`--view-binary/--view-manifest`, else the client's launch service does).

**Web**: `make -C src servers && make -C src web`, then
`src/build/io_server --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini` and open
`http://localhost:8088/` (single tab; `panel=tab` in the manifest gives the
two-tab layout). A web viewer tab boots with
`?editor_view=1&maped=wss://<daemon>&group=N[&camera=...]`. The web build
carries no BuildRunner or launch (TORIRSMAPED_JOBS_NATIVE 0), so BUILD/RUN/
LIVE_ATTACH launch answer UNSUPPORTED there; the native daemon over its
WebSocket transport is the editor server for a web client.

**The launched live lane** (edit, RUN, the live server and clients update):

    torirsmaped ... --content-dir <writable tree> --repo-root . --live-dir <live dir>

`--live-dir` (or `$TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_DIR`) binds the native BuildRunner and
LiveLink. Everything a build writes lands under the live dir:
`scripts/` (base script pack), `scripts_lanes/`, `servpack/`, `cache/` (the
client cache the lane's js5_server serves), `map_archives.txt`. The lane's
launch settings default from `ToriRSMapEd_LaneDefaults`
(src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c) and can be overridden with
`TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_SERVER_BIN`, `_JS5_BIN`, `_IO_BIN`, `_IO_MANIFEST`,
`_IO_ROOT`, `_BASE_CACHE`, `_GAME_PORT`, `_JS5_PORT`, `_IO_PORT`
(src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c `live_lane_from_env`). The Live panel
(View menu) attaches or launches, runs BUILD and RUN, follows a player's
varps, sends cheats and teleports to the selection. The pack build allocates
ids into the content tree's `pack/<ns>.alloc` (that is what allocation is), so
the content dir of a lane must be writable.

The whole loop, scripted, is `make -C src maped-live-e2e`
(src/maped/test/live_e2e/run.sh, below).

## Built, by design section

| § | section | built | not built |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What exists, and the verdict | ToriRSMapEd kept as the authority; documents generalised | — |
| 2 | Architecture | authority + mirrors + facts + group state; EditorHost, BuildRunner and LiveLink vtables; embed, tcp and ws transports | browser host binding for the content tree (IndexedDB / io_server `/boot/`) |
| 3 | Documents and commands | kind-keyed documents (square, spawn, cfg, iface, text); Editor_Cmd per brief §2 with TILE, LOC, SPAWN, SPAWN_SUPPRESS, CFG_FIELD, CFG_BLOCK, IF_FIELD, IF_COMPONENT, TEXT_SPLICE; v2 wire encoding; undo stack grows on demand | DOC_DELETE; DOC_CLOSE unloading; SAVE_AS (reserved, UNSUPPORTED) |

| 5 | Windows, views, cameras | viewer windows as processes (`--editor-view`), STATE_CAMERA publish/follow, SPAWN_VIEW, web viewer tab | layer toggles not read by the painter; embedded editor cannot spawn views; viewer not yet exercised against a daemon in an open window |

| 7 | Chrome | TREE, VLIST, TOOLBAR, SLIDER, RADIO, MODAL, TOOLTIP, CODE, GRAPH, splitter docking; 26 baked skin slots; DOM rendering | DOM multi-panel dock layout |
| 8 | Asset catalog | server-side index of packs, allocs, compacks, config blocks, overlays, interfaces, cs2/rs2 headers, spawns, maps; CATALOG_QUERY/RECORD; mtime refresh | first build blocks the server pump (~1 s warm, ~6 s cold) |
| 9 | Terrain tools | brushes with radius/falloff/step, palettes with shape thumbnails, flags, level radio, rectangle select/copy/paste/fill/clear | — |
| 9b | Square picker and New square | atlas (storages, world-map areas incl. Unmapped instance regions, colour, spawns, flags), picker GRAPH with area tabs, zoom, hover, search, open/shift-open/right-click; New modal (coordinates, storage maps/ or a lane with lane creation, template empty/copy/flat) -> DOC_CREATE | picker Delete only clears the square (no DOC_DELETE); tab strip unreadable with ~50 areas; a NEW square has no `pack/5_maps.pack` line, so BUILD client cache cannot import it yet |
| 10 | Placement tools | loc multi-select, nudge (cross-border as one undo), rotate, reshape, duplicate; spawn place/delete/suppress | — |

## The live lane end to end (phase 4)

`make -C src maped-live-e2e` runs `src/maped/test/live_e2e/run.sh`. It writes
only under `src/build_opt/tmp/live/` and reads OSRS-Content:

1. `mirror.py` makes `content/`, a writable mirror of
   `OSRS-Content/osrs-content` (real directories of per-file symlinks for the
   trees a save or a build writes into; `pack/` copied because ss_allocate
   rewrites ledgers in place; `server/scripts/build*`, `server/pack` and every
   `*.lock` left out; large asset trees linked as directories). A save renames
   over the symlink, so the edited file becomes a real file in the mirror.
2. `lane/` gets copies of the tree's three packs (`server/pack` ->
   `servpack/`, `server/scripts/build` -> `scripts/`,
   `server/scripts/build_summoning_curses` -> `scripts_lanes/`) and of
   `cache.osrs241` (-> `cache/`).
3. torirsmaped serves the mirror with `--live-dir lane/`. The lane's game
   server is `server.sh`: `torirsserver --scriptrun bot.lua --tick-ms 200
   --control-port <game port>` on the lane's packs and cache, so the bot is the
   live player. js5_server is the real one on `lane/cache`.
4. `torirsmapedctl live-attach launch` starts both and attaches; the bot logs
   in and reads Hans's first line.
5. (a) `text-replace rs2:areas/lumbridge/scripts/hans.rs2` through the
   authority, `run`: the RUN saves, builds the packs into the lane, builds the
   client cache, reloads. The bot, never relogged, reads the new line on a
   later Talk-to.
6. (b) `tile-height 50 50 0 22 18 60` on the square the bot stands in, `run`:
   the bot's wire log shows exactly one REBUILD after the reload, and the
   CACHE_INVALIDATE before it.
7. `live-detach` stops the launched processes; OSRS-Content's hans.rs2,
   m50_50.jm2 and `pack/*.alloc` are checked byte-identical to before.

Last run (2026-10-30, integrate-4): **0 failed**. RUN (a) took 52 s (the
first packs build of the mirror plus a 20-type incremental client pack), RUN
(b) 25 s. The bot read "Hello. What are you doing here?" at tick 11, the
RUN (a) reload swapped 1 script (the previous table was freed at once: no
instance on it) and sent one CACHE_INVALIDATE for the 8 client archives the
client build wrote, and the bot read "Hello. What are you doing here,
editor?" at tick 270 on its 37th Talk-to with no login in between. RUN (b)
reloaded m50_50; the bot's wire log holds REBUILD_NORMAL_V2 at tick 0 (login)
and exactly one more at tick 397, after two CACHE_INVALIDATEs in the same
tick. RUN (b) also swapped 7 scripts: the mirror's per-file symlinks follow
OSRS-Content, which other sessions were editing meanwhile.

What the end to end does NOT cover: a real game client (src/torirs) logged
into the lane (the scriptrun bot decodes with the client's parser but has no
cache provider, so CacheProvider_InvalidateArchive is exercised only by
live_reload_test's decode check); io_server (no io manifest in the lane); the
Live panel driving the RUN (torirsmapedctl drives the same frames; the panel
is covered by test-live-panel against the python mock peer); a gated server.

## Open issues

Every issue the phase reports left open, by area, with where to start.

### Documents, protocol, editor server

- DOC_CLOSE never unloads a document (no linger policy):
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c:909 `handle_doc_close`.
- No DOC_DELETE; the picker's Delete clears the square instead:
  src/editor/panels/edpanel_squares.c:845.
- SAVE_AS is reserved and answers UNSUPPORTED (design §15 Save as new):
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c (TORIRSMAPED_REQ_SAVE_AS).
- CFG_BLOCK add/remove leaves a separator blank line on undo when the file
  ended in one: src/editor/editor_cfg.c.
- IF_COMPONENT remove only takes back blocks the stub added: src/editor/editor_if.c.
- A created square carries no `trailing=` line: DOC_CREATE in
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c.
- CFG names over 63 bytes cannot be addressed (EDITOR_CMD_NAME_MAX):
  src/editor/editor_cmd.h:132.
- IF_FIELD values over 190 bytes are read only (the 192-byte before/after
  fields): src/editor/editor_cmd.h.
- The catalog's first build (~1 s warm, ~6 s cold) runs inside the server
  pump: src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_catalog.c.
- The allocator and the vars bit map are not wired to the protocol or a panel:
  src/editor/editor_alloc.c, src/editor/editor_vars.c.
- 3 non-positional compacks are not locked in the mirror: src/editor/editor_if.c.

### World, views, chrome, panels

- EDIT local flush gaps: occluders, minimap icons, LINK_BELOW rebakes:
  src/engine/world_builder/edit/.
- The ghost still displaces through runtime loc changes under EDIT:
  src/editor/map_editor_ghost.c.
- Layer toggles are not read by the painter: src/editor/editor_view.c:359
  (`EditorView_LayerVisible` has no caller in src/app/app_world_paint.c).
- STATE_VAR_PREVIEW is published (src/editor/builder/) but not honoured by the
  world's multiloc/multinpc resolve.
- The embedded editor server cannot spawn views (SPAWN_VIEW answers
  UNSUPPORTED without the daemon's launch binding): src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_view.c.
- The viewer window and Open in new view have not been run against a daemon
  in an open window (only in tests and headless boots).
- The DOM chrome has no multi-panel dock layout: src/plugin_chrome/runtime-source.js.
- The picker's tab strip is unreadable with ~50 areas, and at chrome scale 2
  on a ~1000-row canvas the panels overlap: src/editor/panels/edpanel_squares.c,
  src/editor/editor_ui.c `ui_default_layout`.
- IF1 type 8 (peng_emote) cannot be mounted: src/app/app_iface_editor.c.
- Builder Check (sscompile) and CS2 compile run synchronously on the UI
  thread: src/editor/builder/builder_ssc.c:624 `Builder_SscRun`,
  src/editor/iface/iface_cs2.c:112.
- builder_test uses stand-ins for parts of the tree: src/editor/test/builder_test.c.
- test-bootmanifest cannot run in this worktree (symlinked content root);
  test-world's 19 edge-band failures predate phase 2.
- STATE_LIVE_FOCUS is not followed by viewer windows (design #run: a viewer
  locks its camera to the followed player): src/editor/editor_view.c
  `EditorView_AppOnState`. The position is always -1 today anyway (below).

### Live lane: editor side

- The control protocol has no player list and no player position (CTL_STATUS
  carries a count), so the Live panel shows a count, the followed player is
  typed by name, and STATE_LIVE_FOCUS x/z/level are -1. Needs a CTL_PLAYERS
  frame: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:857 `ctl_send_status`,
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c.
- RUN does not tell the game server which SERVER-PACK groups the packs build
  rewrote: the editor sends only client-cache rows `(2, kind)` and
  `(5, (x << 8) | z)`, while the server re-reads a server-pack group only for
  an index-255 row (torirs_server_control.c `ctl_kind_reload`, :339). So no
  server-side config table is replaced by a RUN today; scripts, squares and
  spawns are. Either the editor diffs the servpack's `pack.manifest` and sends
  255 rows (src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c `jobs_build_finished`), or
  the server diffs its own manifest on RELOAD (docs/serverpack.md hot-reload
  contract §1).
- BUILD "scripts lint" (3) and "cs2 compile" (4) answer UNSUPPORTED:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:151.
- The client cache build is incremental for config types only
  (3rd/rscache/tools/cachepack/cp_incremental.c:1988
  `cp_pack_client_incremental`), plus saved squares by archive. Interfaces,
  CS2 and other assets are not repacked by BUILD client cache.
- cp_pack_client_incremental keeps pack-on-base semantics: a record deleted
  from the text stays in the archive, and routing's "in the base cache" reads
  the live cache, so a record whose `pack/<ns>.client` line was removed can
  stay client-side where a fresh full pack would drop it.
- The client global key hashes the source directory as a string
  (cp_incremental.c:1177): the same tree by another path repacks every type
  (writing nothing when no record differs).
- One CTL_SUBSCRIBE per editor server; the last LIVE_SUBSCRIBE from any window
  wins: src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c:233 `live_send_subscribe`.
- The Restart offer for restart-needed changes is not built; restart rows
  reach FACT_RUN_DONE and the Live panel's log only: src/editor/live/live_panel.c.
- RUN saves every dirty document of every Client (SAVE_ALL) first; a failed
  save stops RUN at "save" but rows that did save are still broadcast:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:1363.
- The pending reload set is bounded (512 squares, 128 spawn files, 4096
  archives); an overflow is logged and the entry dropped:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:1038 `jobs_note_saved`.
- Native runner and launch are compiled out on the web and Windows
  (TORIRSMAPED_JOBS_NATIVE 0, src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:25/37); no
  Windows or Linux compile was run. Linux relies on platform.mk's
  -D_GNU_SOURCE for posix_spawn and realpath.
- The client has no manifest key for a live lane; it binds only through
  `$TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_DIR` (src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c
  `ToriRSMapEd_BindLiveFromEnv`); the daemon also takes `--live-dir`.
- The tracked binary 3rd/rscache/tools/cachepack/cachepack was rebuilt with
  `--incremental` and is committed.

### Live lane: game server and client

- The client's CACHE_INVALIDATE handler drops only interface packs (index 3):
  src/engine/cache_provider.c:1797 `CacheProvider_InvalidateArchive`. Config
  records (2) and client scripts (12) wait for the next login (live state
  holds them; scripts cannot be freed under a running CS2VM2_Frame,
  cache_provider.c:1903). Not built: evicting archives from the sparse dat2
  (src/js5/js5_rscache.c) and IndexedDB (src/web/torirs_idb.js plus a C-to-JS
  bridge), re-priming the reference table from JS5, re-opening mounted
  interfaces, re-resolving on-screen loc/npc/obj records. Maps rely on the
  REBUILD that follows, but the provider's decoded terrain and scenery are not
  evicted, so a real client can rebuild from stale decoded squares until those
  are dropped (needs the dat2 name-hash to square mapping).
- Only SEQUENCE, HEALTHBAR and STRUCT config tables are replaced live; npc,
  loc, obj (live npcs hold `npc->def`; scene.c loads loc collision configs
  once), param, enum, varp, inv and varbit report restart-needed:
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:339 `ctl_kind_reload`,
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_servpack.c:397.
- A login now swaps in a rebuilt script pack (shadow, then swap; the same
  script.dat is a no-op), so a long-running server picks up a pack another
  session rebuilt at the next login; the renumbering check refuses a pack built
  with --renumber: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_scripts.c:955
  `ToriRSServer_ScriptsLoad`.
- Retired script tables are freed when no player, npc, world-queue slot or
  command state has a frame in them; the keys are file-static (16 retired
  tables, 8 stamped servers) because torirs_server.h is closed; over 16 held,
  a reload is refused: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_scripts.c:478.
- Square reload re-reads only the named squares; instance copies made from a
  reloaded source square are not rebuilt, and dynamic loc changes (opened
  doors) in it reset to the cache's state; the reload=1 mark is per pool slot
  and file-static: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_world.c:21434
  `ToriRSServer_WorldReloadSquares`.
- CTL_STATUS stale_count is always 0 (ToriRSServer_PackCheck keeps no list):
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:874.
- The control link is pumped once per tick (each round trip up to 600 ms); not
  supported on win32 (winsock sockets cannot be dup()ed) or the browser server;
  the connection table is process-wide (8 slots):
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:557 `ToriRSServer_ControlAdopt`,
  :1240 `ToriRSServer_ControlTick`.
- torirs_server_control.c is compiled by an `#include` at the end of
  torirs_server_ws.c:658 because src/makefile is closed; moving it into
  TORIRSSERVER_CORE_SRCS needs ws.c's sock_would_block, sock_interrupted and
  sock_set_nonblocking made non-static.
- Spawn reload pairs by (id, x, z, level); a file new since boot merges last,
  so its order can differ from a cold boot; the generated lane
  (areas/world/configs) is refused as restart-needed:
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_world.c:21585, torirs_server_content.c:2237.
- live_reload_test compiles its packs from a stage of the LIVE content tree;
  other sessions' half-done edits can break that compile, so after one
  success it reuses the packs (`packs.ok`,
  src/torirsserver/test/live_reload_test.c:167; LIVE_RELOAD_RESTAGE=1
  rebuilds). It is not on test-editor (boots a whole server).
- test-torirsserver-embed (21 failures) and test-torirsserver-servpack-boot
  fail identically on the phase-3 HEAD (content and scratch-path causes).
