# ToriRSEd status (branch v3-maped, after phase 5)

The design is `docs/MAPED_DESIGN.html`; the per-phase ownership brief is
`docs/MAPED_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. This page says what is built against each
design section, what is not, every open issue the four phases left (with the
file and line to start from), and how to run the editor. Read it first when
picking the editor up again.

Commits: phase 0 `86bc224de` (design + brief), 0b `f2998b6af` (picker and New
square in the brief), 1 `a0eeeb676`, 2 `ffdc6be36`, 3 `aa8798eae`, 4 `ceabbc9c2`,
5 (this commit: the owner's follow-ups after the first live-window run on
2026-10-30 -- dock layout, server catalog panel, record copy, spawn duplicate,
brush footprint, spawn ghosts, History panel, slider skin).

## How to run it

All commands from the repository root. `OSRS-Content` is the content tree the
editor edits; in this worktree it is a symlink into the owner's checkout and is
read only by rule, so editing sessions that SAVE need a writable tree (a real
checkout, or the mirror `src/maped/test/live_e2e/mirror.py` makes).

**Native, one window, embedded editor server** (the default):

    make -C src
    src/torirs --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini

The manifest's `[editor:boot] server=embed` runs ToriRSMapEd inside the
process over `content_dir`. The panel set (menu bar, tool rail, terrain,
palettes, square picker, New, locs, spawns, inspector, catalog, console,
builders, interface and CS2 tools, Live) is in the same window; the View menu
opens the hidden ones. The 3D view is itself a panel, **World**: View > World
hides or shows it, its title bar moves it and its grip resizes it like any
other panel.

**Environment the editor client reads** (beside the manifest):

- `TORIRS_EDITOR_LAYOUT` -- where the dock layout is saved (below). Unset:
  `editor_layout.ini` in the working directory (IndexedDB on the web);
  empty: no layout is read or written (what every headless harness sets);
  else that path. Same rule as `TORIRS_PREFS` for `preferences.ini`.
- `TORIRS_PREFS`, `TORIRS_PLUGINS=0` (photographs and checks run with plugins
  off), `TORIRS_PRESENT_BMP` + `TORIRS_PRESENT_BMP_FRAME` (write one frame as a
  BMP: the photograph recipe, never a desktop screenshot),
  `TORIRS_EDITOR_HOVER` (park the hover, src/app/app_map_editor.c),
  `TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_DIR` (the live lane, below).

**The saved layout.** Every panel's box, whether it is open, whether the user
placed it, and View > Snap to grid persist across launches in
`editor_layout.ini` (format and policy: src/editor/editor_layout.h). It is
read at boot through the App's task queue (the default layout waits for it,
so nothing flashes at its default place first) and written a few frames
after any change settles -- a drag or resize released, a View toggle, Reset
layout, Snap to grid, a window resize -- and once after boot. Both trips are
`ToriRS_IO_QueueFileRead`/`QueueFileWrite` items (src/editor/
task_editor_layout_io.c): on the desktop platform_x_io.c reads/writes the
file; on the web platform_web_io.js hands the same items to
`host.readClientFile`/`host.writeClientFile` (src/web/torirs_hostio.js),
which keep it in IndexedDB. A file made for the same surface and scale puts
every panel back exactly; on another surface only the panels the user placed
keep their boxes (pulled back onto the surface if it shrank) and the rest are
laid out for the new surface. View > Reset layout returns to the default (not
to the file) and saves that. To move a panel by hand, set `user_placed = 1`
and its `x/y/w/h` (chrome pixels at scale 1) in the file.

**Native, against the daemon** (several windows on one tree):

    make -C src torirsmaped torirsmapedctl
    src/build_opt/torirsmaped 43610 --content-dir OSRS-Content/osrs-content --repo-root . \
        [--view-binary src/torirs --view-manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini] \
        [--live-dir <dir>]

then boot the client with `server=tcp` in `[editor:boot]` (host/port default
localhost:43610). `torirsmapedctl` drives the same daemon headless: `status`,
`squares`, `open`, `doc`, `new`, `select`, `undo`/`redo`, `save`, and since
phase 4 `text-replace`, `tile-height`, `live-attach`, `live-detach`,
`live-cheat`, `build packs|client`, `run`, and for spawns and records:

    torirsmapedctl spawn-edit [gen:]<kind> <name> <x> <z> <level> [count] to <kind> <name> <x> <z> <level> [count]
    torirsmapedctl spawn-move [gen:]<kind> <name> <x> <z> <level> [count] to <x> <z> [level]
    torirsmapedctl cfg-set <type>:<name>[@<overlay>] <key[#n][@line]> <value|->

A spawn row is `<kind> <name> <x> <z> <level> [count]`: kind `npc`/`obj`
(`-npc`/`-obj` for a suppression row), the name a pack symbol or `#<id>`,
ABSOLUTE tiles, a count for an obj only. Same square and kind is one
SPAWN_EDIT in place; anything else a delete and an add; one undo step either
way. `gen:` edits a row of the GENERATED file (areas/world): it is suppressed
and the new row added to the edited file. `cfg-set` is one CFG_FIELD on a
record block (`-` removes the field).

CFG keys: `<type>:<name>` is the `[name]` block of `configs/all.<type>`;
`<type>:<name>@<overlay>` is that block in a SERVER OVERLAY, `<overlay>` a
path under `server/scripts` ending `.<type>`
(`npc:giantspider1@areas/lumbridge/configs/lumbridge.npc`,
`npc:giantspider1@_explicit/configs/server_fields.generated.npc`). Either is
block-scoped (the 10 MB generated overlay is never loaded whole) and saved
back over its block with every other byte kept. `fields:<type>.ini` is the
read-only TEXT document of a type's field register.

**Viewer window** (a second camera on the same session):

    src/torirs --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini --editor-view \
        --maped tcp://127.0.0.1:43610 --maped-group <client id> --camera x,z,level,yaw,pitch,zoom

or "Open in new view" in the picker (the daemon spawns it when started with
`--view-binary/--view-manifest`, else the client's launch service does).

**Web**: `make -C src servers && make -C src web`, then
`src/build/io_server --manifest manifests/manifest_osrs241_mapeditor.ini` and open
`http://localhost:8088/` (single tab; `panel=tab` in the manifest gives the
two-tab layout). A web viewer tab boots with
`?editor_view=1&maped=wss://<daemon>&group=N[&camera=...]`. The web build
carries no BuildRunner or launch (TORIRSMAPED_JOBS_NATIVE 0), so BUILD/RUN/
LIVE_ATTACH launch answer UNSUPPORTED there; the native daemon over its
WebSocket transport is the editor server for a web client.

**The launched live lane** (edit, RUN, the live server and clients update):

    torirsmaped ... --content-dir <writable tree> --repo-root . --live-dir <live dir>

`--live-dir` (or `$TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_DIR`) binds the native BuildRunner and
LiveLink. Everything a build writes lands under the live dir:
`scripts/` (base script pack), `scripts_lanes/`, `servpack/`, `cache/` (the
client cache the lane's js5_server serves), `map_archives.txt`. The lane's
launch settings default from `ToriRSMapEd_LaneDefaults`
(src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c) and can be overridden with
`TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_SERVER_BIN`, `_JS5_BIN`, `_IO_BIN`, `_IO_MANIFEST`,
`_IO_ROOT`, `_BASE_CACHE`, `_GAME_PORT`, `_JS5_PORT`, `_IO_PORT`
(src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c `live_lane_from_env`). The Live panel
(View menu) attaches or launches, runs BUILD and RUN, follows a player's
varps, sends cheats and teleports to the selection. The pack build allocates
ids into the content tree's `pack/<ns>.alloc` (that is what allocation is), so
the content dir of a lane must be writable.

The whole loop, scripted, is `make -C src maped-live-e2e`
(src/maped/test/live_e2e/run.sh, below).

## Built, by design section

| § | section | built | not built |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What exists, and the verdict | ToriRSMapEd kept as the authority; documents generalised | — |
| 2 | Architecture | authority + mirrors + facts + group state; EditorHost, BuildRunner and LiveLink vtables; embed, tcp and ws transports | browser host binding for the content tree (IndexedDB / io_server `/boot/`) |
| 3 | Documents and commands | kind-keyed documents (square, spawn, cfg incl. server-overlay blocks `<type>:<name>@<overlay>`, iface, text incl. `fields:<type>.ini`); Editor_Cmd per brief §2 with TILE, LOC, SPAWN, SPAWN_SUPPRESS, CFG_FIELD, CFG_BLOCK, IF_FIELD, IF_COMPONENT, TEXT_SPLICE, and SPAWN_EDIT (kind 9: one row rewritten in place, wire `before row, after row, string before_text`, a row being `u32 is_obj, u32 suppress, string name, u32 x, u32 z, u32 level, u32 count`); v2 wire encoding; undo stack grows on demand | DOC_DELETE; DOC_CLOSE unloading; SAVE_AS (reserved, UNSUPPORTED) |
| 4 | The editing World | WorldBuilderOps with STATIC (pure refactor) and EDIT (resident build maps, placement handles, tile-local flush); `[world:boot] layout=`; per-tile derive | local flush gaps (occluders, minimap icons, LINK_BELOW rebakes); ghost under EDIT still uses runtime loc changes |
| 5 | Windows, views, cameras | viewer windows as processes (`--editor-view`), STATE_CAMERA publish/follow, SPAWN_VIEW, web viewer tab | layer toggles not read by the painter; embedded editor cannot spawn views; viewer not yet exercised against a daemon in an open window |
| 6 | Server state and protocol | protocol v2, HELLO capabilities, frame/state-key reservations, group state relay | — |
| 7 | Chrome | TREE, VLIST, TOOLBAR, SLIDER (settings-bar track 2852/2855/2857, gem knob 2858, label column <= 30%), RADIO, MODAL, TOOLTIP, CODE, GRAPH, splitter docking; grid snap on drag/resize release (`ToriRSChrome_SetSnap`, 8 px at 1x, 16 at 2x, edge snap within one cell); 28 baked skin slots; DOM rendering; hollow panels (`ToriRSChrome_PanelSetHollow`: title bar, rails and grip drawn and hit, the body neither painted nor hit, `ToriRSChrome_PanelBodyRect`); the dock layout persisted per device in `editor_layout.ini` (`TORIRS_EDITOR_LAYOUT`; codec src/editor/editor_layout.c, IO tasks src/editor/task_editor_layout_io.c, debounce `app_map_editor_layout_tick`; desktop file / web IndexedDB through host.readClientFile/writeClientFile) | DOM multi-panel dock layout; a drag still in progress at quit is not saved |
| 7b | World panel | the 3D view is the registry module "world" (editor_ui.c `ui_world_register`, first chrome panel so it draws under the rest): titled, resizable, hollow; in the View menu; the default layout docks it over exactly the region the old world rect was; `Editor_UiWorldRect` is its body; the App cuts the world widget to it through the reference letterbox (`App_MapEditorWorldLetterbox` answers UITREE_HOST_GET_WORLD_LETTERBOX: the 3D pass draws in the body, the rest of the widget box is the black band) and restates `world_emit_desc` (`App_MapEditorWorldView`), so the paint, picks, hover, brush footprint, ghosts and selection marks all follow it; hidden World = no world drawn or picked; part of the saved layout; viewer windows (panels hidden) keep the whole frame | the box origin of the world widget is taken from last frame's desc (the letterbox request carries only its size); the panel has no maximise / dock-to-edge gesture |
| 8 | Asset catalog | server-side index of packs, allocs, compacks, config blocks, overlays, interfaces, cs2/rs2 headers, spawns, maps; CATALOG_QUERY/RECORD (a record's fields in the pack's merge order: all.<type>, `.generated.` overlays, authored overlays, path order within a rank); mtime refresh; the Catalog panel queries it (every kind, settled find, paged list, record view, Edit record..., Copy to new; edpanel_catalog_model.c) | first build blocks the server pump (~1 s warm, ~6 s cold) |
| 9 | Terrain tools | brushes with radius/falloff/step, palettes with shape thumbnails, flags, level radio, rectangle select/copy/paste/fill/clear; brush footprint under the pointer (`Editor_Terrain_BrushFootprint`, same weights as the stroke, falloff shown as wash intensity, follows a drag; >121 tiles as nested washes) | — |
| 9b | Square picker and New square | atlas (storages, world-map areas incl. Unmapped instance regions, colour, spawns, flags), picker GRAPH with area tabs, zoom, hover, search, open/shift-open/right-click; New modal (coordinates, storage maps/ or a lane with lane creation, template empty/copy/flat) -> DOC_CREATE | picker Delete only clears the square (no DOC_DELETE); tab strip unreadable with ~50 areas; a NEW square has no `pack/5_maps.pack` line, so BUILD client cache cannot import it yet |
| 10 | Placement tools | loc multi-select, nudge (cross-border as one undo), rotate, reshape, duplicate; spawn place/delete/suppress, spawn multi-select and Duplicate [D]; translucent npc/obj placement ghost with footprint (`map_editor_ghost.c` spawn ghost, Place click writes the spawn row via `Editor_Locs_PlaceSpawn`); Move tool outlines every selected loc's destination; **spawn edit form** (Spawns > Edit tab: kind, name -- pack symbol, `#<id>`, or a display name the catalog resolves, refused when unknown -- abs X/Z, level, count, Suppressed; Apply = one undo step "edit spawn"/"move spawn" via `Editor_SpawnEditPlan`: SPAWN_EDIT in place, delete+add across a square or kind, suppress+add for a generated row; a multi-selection takes each changed field, X/Z/Level as an offset); **spawn move** typed or "Move: click a tile" (the next world click, `editor_panel.c`), the destination footprint and wander square previewed under the pointer; **wander preview** ("Show wander range", default on: each selected npc's wanderrange square filled and maxrange leash outlined on its level, also around the npc spawn ghost; values from the Record panel when it holds the npc, else the catalog's merged record, else 5/7; `MapEditorWander_Rects`, drawn in `app_overlay.c`); orphan `-name` rows listed and editable; ctl `spawn-edit`/`spawn-move` | arrow nudges commit per press (no preview); the move preview is footprint + wander square, not a translucent npc model; a delete+add edit's undo re-adds the row at its section's end |
| 11 | Loc interaction builder | `.interaction` model, loc emitter (oploc/oplocu/aploc), step templates, sscompile Check | Check runs synchronously on the UI thread |
| 12 | NPC interaction and dialogue builder | npc emitter, dialogue graph to nested if/else, multiloc/multinpc shell editor; **Record panel** (Catalog > Edit record..., Spawns > Edit npc record...): one loc/npc/obj record over every file that states it -- `configs/all.<type>` and each server overlay the catalog lists, as block-scoped CFG documents -- every field resolved to the layer that wins it (rank 0/1/2, path order, `param=<name>,..` per name), plus every key of `fields/<type>.ini` the record states nowhere; Set field writes where the field is stated or "override in <layer>" (opening the block there with CFG_BLOCK if needed), Remove field shows the layer beneath; one undo step "edit record"; `editor_cfg.h` Editor_CfgRecord; ctl `cfg-set` | STATE_VAR_PREVIEW not honoured by the world's multiloc resolve |
| 13 | Varp and varbit editor | editor_vars bit map, overlap check, naming; editor_alloc mirrors ss_allocate.py | allocator and vars not wired to the protocol or a panel; constants; live ::getvar/::setvar |
| 14 | CS2 and the interface editor | `.if`/`.compack` codec (982 interfaces byte exact), component tree, inspector, hooks, CS2 run/trace/watch, CODE editor with `cs2 compile`, App mount/pick/refill | IF1 type 8 not mountable; IF_FIELD values over 190 bytes read only; cs2 compile synchronous |
| 15 | Save, save as new, export, pack | atomic text saves, FACT_SAVED; SAVE_AS of a loc/npc/obj record (fresh id in pack/<type>.alloc, .client line, every field; one undo step; catalog and shell editor "Copy to new...", `torirsmapedctl cfg-copy`); BUILD packs (`make torirsserver-packs` into the live dir); BUILD client cache (`cachepack pack --incremental`, only changed archives written, reference table bumped, plus saved squares by archive) | Save as new for squares (DOC_CREATE copy covers it), interfaces and builder subjects; export/import lane; incremental repack of interfaces, CS2 and other assets in BUILD client cache; scripts lint and cs2 compile as BUILD kinds |
| 16 | RUN and the live lane | RUN = SAVE_ALL -> packs -> client cache -> CTL_RELOAD -> FACT_RUN_DONE/LIVE_STATUS, stop at first failure, pending set kept on a failed reload; control link (0xED) with gate ticket; script hot reload (shadow table, swap at the tick boundary, old table freed when no frame holds it); sequence/healthbar/struct config groups live; square reload with one REBUILD per covering player and reload=1 on REBUILD_REGION; edited-lane spawn reload; CACHE_INVALIDATE (our opcode 237) sent at 239/241 before the REBUILD; Live panel; launch and attach; scriptrun `--control-port` | client cache eviction beyond interface packs; player list and position in the control protocol; Restart offer; stale list (always 0) |
| 17 | The web | wasm editor client, viewer tab boot, capabilities gate the menus | browser BuildRunner/LiveLink (answer UNSUPPORTED); content tree host binding |
| 3b | History panel | `Editor_History` (editor_cmd.c) rebuilt from the FACT_CMD stream + own undo/redo; rows newest first with names ("Raise 21 tiles m50_50 L0", "New square m1_1 (copy of m50_50)"), undone prefix, current marker, filter by key, click-to-jump; rebuilds only on serial change | a late-joining window lists only steps since it connected; another window's long drag may show as several rows until an undo re-cuts them |
| 5b | Default layout | `Editor_UiLayout` (editor_ui.c) at boot/resize/scale/Reset: menu bar full width, tool rail wraps to 2+ columns, one right column 22% (200..400 px at 1x; order terrain, palette, locs, spawns, rect, inspector, squares, catalog, history), panels admitted while >= 160 px, spare height shared, console strip under the world when <= 1/4 height, the World panel docked over what is left; a saved layout (`editor_layout.ini`) applied before the first pass; panels that do not fit are hidden (View menu); dragged panels keep their place until View > Reset layout; View > Snap to grid | tested 1280x800..2560x1440 at scale 1 and 2 headless + photographed at 1280/1530/1920 |

## The live lane end to end (phase 4)

`make -C src maped-live-e2e` runs `src/maped/test/live_e2e/run.sh`. It writes
only under `src/build_opt/tmp/live/` and reads OSRS-Content:

1. `mirror.py` makes `content/`, a writable mirror of
   `OSRS-Content/osrs-content` (real directories of per-file symlinks for the
   trees a save or a build writes into; `pack/` copied because ss_allocate
   rewrites ledgers in place; `server/scripts/build*`, `server/pack` and every
   `*.lock` left out; large asset trees linked as directories). A save renames
   over the symlink, so the edited file becomes a real file in the mirror.
2. `lane/` gets copies of the tree's three packs (`server/pack` ->
   `servpack/`, `server/scripts/build` -> `scripts/`,
   `server/scripts/build_summoning_curses` -> `scripts_lanes/`) and of
   `cache.osrs241` (-> `cache/`).
3. torirsmaped serves the mirror with `--live-dir lane/`. The lane's game
   server is `server.sh`: `torirsserver --scriptrun bot.lua --tick-ms 200
   --control-port <game port>` on the lane's packs and cache, so the bot is the
   live player. js5_server is the real one on `lane/cache`.
4. `torirsmapedctl live-attach launch` starts both and attaches; the bot logs
   in and reads Hans's first line.
5. (a) `text-replace rs2:areas/lumbridge/scripts/hans.rs2` through the
   authority, `run`: the RUN saves, builds the packs into the lane, builds the
   client cache, reloads. The bot, never relogged, reads the new line on a
   later Talk-to.
6. (b) `tile-height 50 50 0 22 18 60` on the square the bot stands in, `run`:
   the bot's wire log shows exactly one REBUILD after the reload, and the
   CACHE_INVALIDATE before it.
7. `live-detach` stops the launched processes; OSRS-Content's hans.rs2,
   m50_50.jm2 and `pack/*.alloc` are checked byte-identical to before.

Last run (2026-10-30, integrate-4): **0 failed**. RUN (a) took 52 s (the
first packs build of the mirror plus a 20-type incremental client pack), RUN
(b) 25 s. The bot read "Hello. What are you doing here?" at tick 11, the
RUN (a) reload swapped 1 script (the previous table was freed at once: no
instance on it) and sent one CACHE_INVALIDATE for the 8 client archives the
client build wrote, and the bot read "Hello. What are you doing here,
editor?" at tick 270 on its 37th Talk-to with no login in between. RUN (b)
reloaded m50_50; the bot's wire log holds REBUILD_NORMAL_V2 at tick 0 (login)
and exactly one more at tick 397, after two CACHE_INVALIDATEs in the same
tick. RUN (b) also swapped 7 scripts: the mirror's per-file symlinks follow
OSRS-Content, which other sessions were editing meanwhile.

What the end to end does NOT cover: a real game client (src/torirs) logged
into the lane (the scriptrun bot decodes with the client's parser but has no
cache provider, so CacheProvider_InvalidateArchive is exercised only by
live_reload_test's decode check); io_server (no io manifest in the lane); the
Live panel driving the RUN (torirsmapedctl drives the same frames; the panel
is covered by test-live-panel against the python mock peer); a gated server.

## Open issues

Every issue the phase reports left open, by area, with where to start.

### Documents, protocol, editor server

- DOC_CLOSE never unloads a document (no linger policy):
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c:909 `handle_doc_close`.
- No DOC_DELETE; the picker's Delete clears the square instead:
  src/editor/panels/edpanel_squares.c:845.
- npc_stats/*.stats, npc_combat/*.combat and npc_movement/*.move are not
  record layers in the Record panel (the catalog lists the first two as
  sources; the panel edits `configs/all.<type>` and `server/scripts` overlays
  only): src/editor/panels/edpanel_catalog.c `Editor_Record_Open`.
- The Record panel finds overlays through the catalog (the record's
  sources); without a catalog only `configs/all.<type>` is edited, and an
  overlay that does not state the record yet is not offered (override goes
  into the layers listed).
- The wander preview's catalog values are the SAVED files'; an unsaved edit
  shows only while the Record panel holds that npc.
- SAVE_AS copies only loc / npc / obj records, and only their cache block
  (configs/all.<type>): server overlay fields are not copied, and the copy
  is written into configs/all.<type>, not a server overlay file. Other kinds
  answer UNSUPPORTED: src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c `handle_save_as`.
- CFG_BLOCK add/remove leaves a separator blank line on undo when the file
  ended in one: src/editor/editor_cfg.c.
- IF_COMPONENT remove only takes back blocks the stub added: src/editor/editor_if.c.
- A created square carries no `trailing=` line: DOC_CREATE in
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped.c.
- CFG names over 63 bytes cannot be addressed (EDITOR_CMD_NAME_MAX):
  src/editor/editor_cmd.h:132.
- IF_FIELD values over 190 bytes are read only (the 192-byte before/after
  fields): src/editor/editor_cmd.h.
- The catalog's first build (~1 s warm, ~6 s cold) runs inside the server
  pump: src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_catalog.c.
- The allocator is wired only to SAVE_AS; the vars bit map is not wired to
  the protocol or a panel: src/editor/editor_alloc.c, src/editor/editor_vars.c.
- 3 non-positional compacks are not locked in the mirror: src/editor/editor_if.c.

### World, views, chrome, panels

- EDIT local flush gaps: occluders, minimap icons, LINK_BELOW rebakes:
  src/engine/world_builder/edit/.
- The ghost still displaces through runtime loc changes under EDIT:
  src/editor/map_editor_ghost.c.
- Layer toggles are not read by the painter: src/editor/editor_view.c:359
  (`EditorView_LayerVisible` has no caller in src/app/app_world_paint.c).
- STATE_VAR_PREVIEW is published (src/editor/builder/) but not honoured by the
  world's multiloc/multinpc resolve.
- The embedded editor server cannot spawn views (SPAWN_VIEW answers
  UNSUPPORTED without the daemon's launch binding): src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_view.c.
- The viewer window and Open in new view have not been run against a daemon
  in an open window (only in tests and headless boots).
- The DOM chrome has no multi-panel dock layout: src/plugin_chrome/runtime-source.js.
- The saved layout is written a few frames after a change settles and once
  more at shutdown (`app_map_editor_layout_flush`, run by hand on its own IO
  batch from App_Shutdown before Editor_PanelFree, like app_prefs_flush); a
  drag still in progress at quit is not written. Viewer windows the daemon
  spawns go through the launch service's `view_environment`, which sets
  `TORIRS_EDITOR_LAYOUT=` like the party seats, so they never read or write
  the device's layout file.
- World overlays: everything that marks the world (brush footprint, spawn and
  loc ghosts, selection, hover; src/app/app_overlay.c and
  src/editor/map_editor_ghost.c) projects through `app->world_emit_desc`
  (src/app/app_world_project.c), which `App_MapEditorWorldView` sets to the
  World panel's body each frame -- a new overlay that projects the same way
  follows the panel with no extra code; one that draws in screen space must
  clip to `Editor_UiWorldRect`.
- (closed in phase 5) the picker's tab strip is gone (the Area dropdown picks
  the area) and the default layout no longer overlaps; the atlas re-fits to the
  panel until the user zooms or pans. Still open: the viewer window's toolbar
  never calls `ToriRSChrome_SetSnap`; the web executor's sprite list lacks the
  two new slider slots (src/plugin_chrome/runtime*.js draws an HTML range input).
- The npc placement ghost is a real scene npc, so it appears under the cursor
  in the right-click menu while it is up: src/app/app_map_editor.c.
- `TORIRS_EDITOR_HOVER=<x>,<z>[,<tool>[,npc|obj|loc,<id>]]` parks the editor
  hover for photographs (documented in src/app/app_map_editor.c); there is still
  no pointer injection for a scripted click.
- IF1 type 8 (peng_emote) cannot be mounted: src/app/app_iface_editor.c.
- Builder Check (sscompile) and CS2 compile run synchronously on the UI
  thread: src/editor/builder/builder_ssc.c:624 `Builder_SscRun`,
  src/editor/iface/iface_cs2.c:112.
- builder_test uses stand-ins for parts of the tree: src/editor/test/builder_test.c.
- test-bootmanifest cannot run in this worktree (symlinked content root);
  test-world's 19 edge-band failures predate phase 2.
- STATE_LIVE_FOCUS is not followed by viewer windows (design #run: a viewer
  locks its camera to the followed player): src/editor/editor_view.c
  `EditorView_AppOnState`. The position is always -1 today anyway (below).

### Live lane: editor side

- The control protocol has no player list and no player position (CTL_STATUS
  carries a count), so the Live panel shows a count, the followed player is
  typed by name, and STATE_LIVE_FOCUS x/z/level are -1. Needs a CTL_PLAYERS
  frame: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:857 `ctl_send_status`,
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c.
- RUN does not tell the game server which SERVER-PACK groups the packs build
  rewrote: the editor sends only client-cache rows `(2, kind)` and
  `(5, (x << 8) | z)`, while the server re-reads a server-pack group only for
  an index-255 row (torirs_server_control.c `ctl_kind_reload`, :339). So no
  server-side config table is replaced by a RUN today; scripts, squares and
  spawns are. Either the editor diffs the servpack's `pack.manifest` and sends
  255 rows (src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c `jobs_build_finished`), or
  the server diffs its own manifest on RELOAD (docs/serverpack.md hot-reload
  contract §1).
- BUILD "scripts lint" (3) and "cs2 compile" (4) answer UNSUPPORTED:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:151.
- The client cache build is incremental for config types only
  (3rd/rscache/tools/cachepack/cp_incremental.c:1988
  `cp_pack_client_incremental`), plus saved squares by archive. Interfaces,
  CS2 and other assets are not repacked by BUILD client cache.
- cp_pack_client_incremental keeps pack-on-base semantics: a record deleted
  from the text stays in the archive, and routing's "in the base cache" reads
  the live cache, so a record whose `pack/<ns>.client` line was removed can
  stay client-side where a fresh full pack would drop it.
- The client global key hashes the source directory as a string
  (cp_incremental.c:1177): the same tree by another path repacks every type
  (writing nothing when no record differs).
- One CTL_SUBSCRIBE per editor server; the last LIVE_SUBSCRIBE from any window
  wins: src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c:233 `live_send_subscribe`.
- The Restart offer for restart-needed changes is not built; restart rows
  reach FACT_RUN_DONE and the Live panel's log only: src/editor/live/live_panel.c.
- RUN saves every dirty document of every Client (SAVE_ALL) first; a failed
  save stops RUN at "save" but rows that did save are still broadcast:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:1363.
- The pending reload set is bounded (512 squares, 128 spawn files, 4096
  archives); an overflow is logged and the entry dropped:
  src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:1038 `jobs_note_saved`.
- Native runner and launch are compiled out on the web and Windows
  (TORIRSMAPED_JOBS_NATIVE 0, src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_build.c:25/37); no
  Windows or Linux compile was run. Linux relies on platform.mk's
  -D_GNU_SOURCE for posix_spawn and realpath.
- The client has no manifest key for a live lane; it binds only through
  `$TORIRSMAPED_LIVE_DIR` (src/torirsmaped/torirs_maped_live.c
  `ToriRSMapEd_BindLiveFromEnv`); the daemon also takes `--live-dir`.
- The tracked binary 3rd/rscache/tools/cachepack/cachepack was rebuilt with
  `--incremental` and is committed.

### Live lane: game server and client

- The client's CACHE_INVALIDATE handler drops only interface packs (index 3):
  src/engine/cache_provider.c:1797 `CacheProvider_InvalidateArchive`. Config
  records (2) and client scripts (12) wait for the next login (live state
  holds them; scripts cannot be freed under a running CS2VM2_Frame,
  cache_provider.c:1903). Not built: evicting archives from the sparse dat2
  (src/js5/js5_rscache.c) and IndexedDB (src/web/torirs_idb.js plus a C-to-JS
  bridge), re-priming the reference table from JS5, re-opening mounted
  interfaces, re-resolving on-screen loc/npc/obj records. Maps rely on the
  REBUILD that follows, but the provider's decoded terrain and scenery are not
  evicted, so a real client can rebuild from stale decoded squares until those
  are dropped (needs the dat2 name-hash to square mapping).
- Only SEQUENCE, HEALTHBAR and STRUCT config tables are replaced live; npc,
  loc, obj (live npcs hold `npc->def`; scene.c loads loc collision configs
  once), param, enum, varp, inv and varbit report restart-needed:
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:339 `ctl_kind_reload`,
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_servpack.c:397.
- A login now swaps in a rebuilt script pack (shadow, then swap; the same
  script.dat is a no-op), so a long-running server picks up a pack another
  session rebuilt at the next login; the renumbering check refuses a pack built
  with --renumber: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_scripts.c:955
  `ToriRSServer_ScriptsLoad`.
- Retired script tables are freed when no player, npc, world-queue slot or
  command state has a frame in them; the keys are file-static (16 retired
  tables, 8 stamped servers) because torirs_server.h is closed; over 16 held,
  a reload is refused: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_scripts.c:478.
- Square reload re-reads only the named squares; instance copies made from a
  reloaded source square are not rebuilt, and dynamic loc changes (opened
  doors) in it reset to the cache's state; the reload=1 mark is per pool slot
  and file-static: src/torirsserver/torirs_server_world.c:21434
  `ToriRSServer_WorldReloadSquares`.
- CTL_STATUS stale_count is always 0 (ToriRSServer_PackCheck keeps no list):
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:874.
- The control link is pumped once per tick (each round trip up to 600 ms); not
  supported on win32 (winsock sockets cannot be dup()ed) or the browser server;
  the connection table is process-wide (8 slots):
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_control.c:557 `ToriRSServer_ControlAdopt`,
  :1240 `ToriRSServer_ControlTick`.
- torirs_server_control.c is compiled by an `#include` at the end of
  torirs_server_ws.c:658 because src/makefile is closed; moving it into
  TORIRSSERVER_CORE_SRCS needs ws.c's sock_would_block, sock_interrupted and
  sock_set_nonblocking made non-static.
- Spawn reload pairs by (id, x, z, level); a file new since boot merges last,
  so its order can differ from a cold boot; the generated lane
  (areas/world/configs) is refused as restart-needed:
  src/torirsserver/torirs_server_world.c:21585, torirs_server_content.c:2237.
- live_reload_test compiles its packs from a stage of the LIVE content tree;
  other sessions' half-done edits can break that compile, so after one
  success it reuses the packs (`packs.ok`,
  src/torirsserver/test/live_reload_test.c:167; LIVE_RELOAD_RESTAGE=1
  rebuilds). It is not on test-editor (boots a whole server).
- test-torirsserver-embed (21 failures) and test-torirsserver-servpack-boot
  fail identically on the phase-3 HEAD (content and scratch-path causes).
